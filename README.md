🧳 Australian Travel Motives Clustering with Machine Learning
A machine learning project focused on segmenting tourists based on their travel motivations using unsupervised learning techniques. This project leverages KMeans clustering, PCA visualization, and demographic profiling to reveal key patterns in Australian travel behavior.

✨ Highlights
✅ Cleaned and preprocessed binary survey data (yes/no motives)

📊 Visualized 2D clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

🎯 Identified optimal clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score

👥 Segmented tourists based on motives like relaxation, nature, culture, etc.

🔍 Cluster profiling with demographics: age, gender, education, income

📁 Final output includes a downloadable .csv of cluster-labeled data
